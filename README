This is an client side alternative to the Facebook Multi-Friend Selector that 
relies on jQuery. No server side component necessary which makes it really
easy to adapt and use. 

This plugin is depends on the new Facebook Javascript API
<script src="http://connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js"></script>

STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS

... but there's now a jquery plugin and accompanying CSS file

Assuming you have a container like:
<div id="jfmfs-container"></div>

And you have included the Facebook Javascript API

And you have already logged the user in. (FB.init and FB.login)

You can load the friend selector in a container like this:
$("#jfmfs-container").jfmfs();

This should fetch the current users friends and give you the interface to select friends. Then when you're ready to move on, there's a function to call that returns an array of the Facebook Ids of the selected friends. 

var friendSelector  = $("#jfmfs-container").data('jfmfs');
var selectedFriends = friendSelector.getSelectedIds();
